# Algebra module
**SH_Algebra** module for **SHCPP** (Shrimp's C++ Framework)
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Dependencies:** none


## Description
This module provides base types for algebraic operations, currently implemented types:
* Point (in 2D space)
* LinkedPoint (in 2D space)
* Triangle (in 2D space)
* Contour (in 2D space)

## Roadmap
* More base types for 2D operations and algebraic operations
* Basic 3D space types
